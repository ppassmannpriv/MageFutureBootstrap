# Future Magento Theme
## Base template for myself with some Grunt in it

I was looking for some ways to speed up development and well what else to use then Grunt? I quite like it and I'm new to grunt.
Later on this will probably also get some bootstrap forced in. I like bootstrap and all the responsive stuff done for me. I don't like manual labour.
